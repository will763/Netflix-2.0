# Netflix 2.0

Netflix homepage clone developed during Digital Innovation One's Take Blip Web Developer Bootcamp.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Netflix 2.0](https://netflix-2-0-danfwnwwc-will763.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/) - React Carousel

### What I learned

Installing React Slick to create a carousel with trending content, I had to adapt the carousel for different screen types.
